This some fun stuff I picked up from the 2020 offering of the fantastic [./missing-semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) class at MIT. 

Enjoy!

## Lecture 1: Shell basics

### Redirection and piping

- `>` and `<` redirect output from and to a file or stream.
- `x < y` redirects `y` as input to `x`. 
- `x > y` redirects output of `x` to `y`.
- `<<` and `>>` will append as opposed to overwrite.
- `|` chains program together.

### Use single quotations to nullify meaning

> Enclosing characters in single quotes (‘'’) preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.[^1]

### sudo

`sudo` stands for "super user do".

## Lecture 2: Shell tools and scripting

### Setting variables

Set variables with `x=foo` with no spaces between anything.

Access it with `echo $x`.
