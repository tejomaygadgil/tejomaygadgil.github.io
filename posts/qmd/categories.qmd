Few essays in the history of philosophy are as impactful, less as inscrutable, and none as impactful for *being* inscrutable as Aristotle's *Categories*.

The central tension of this work between utterance (τὰ λεγόμενα) and beings (τὰ ὄντα) has divided readers for over twenty-five centuries as to what it is actually about. Language? Logic? Metaphysics? Something else entirely?

Introducing such an evasive text is impossible: the full account of its meaning and history is scarcely imaginable, while factual "hors d'oeuvres," no matter how well presented, fail to introduce the actual _work_ in question. 

Summary cannot introduce us to the *Categories*. Instead we must interpret it.

To interpret something means to put it in your own words. In interpretation the barrier between the work being interpreted and the work of interpretation begins to sway. This softening the offset between ourselves and what we were trying to understand is what we call being "introduced." Interpretation is always difficult, not just because it is "hard," but because it is fundamentally _productive_.

This introduction, therefore, is nothing other than a plain English interpretation of the *Categories*, where "plain" hardly means easy or simple. Decisions have been made and points have been rendered in order to practically engage the reader with the material ordering the words on the page.

## Things can have a common name for different reasons

Synonyms have a common name for the same reason: a cat and a bird are both "animals" because they are both living entities.

Homonyms have a common name for different reasons: a cello and a microscope are both "instruments," the former because it produces music, and the latter because it is a tool for science.

Paronyms share a common root: to preach and preacher, for instance.

## Beings can be predicates, and they can be properties

Utterances (τὰ λεγόμενα) can be interwoven or not: the former makes sentences such as "The man runs," while the latter produces simple terms such as "man," and "runs."

Beings (τὰ ὄντα) can distinguished in two ways: as predicates, or as properties.

Predicates describe a subject (καθ' ὑποκειμένου λέγεται). Man, for instance, is the entity that characterizes a person, and tall is something that describes a redwood tree. Predicates are always generic.

Particular things are the opposite of a predicate. You cannot describe anything using a particular. Particulars cannot complete a sentence of the type "X is \_\_\_."

Consider your phone. It is a particular entity. *Your phone could never describe another entity*; rather it can only *be* described by generic predicates such as model number, color, size, shape, and so on. Even the seeming counter-example "My favorite thing is this phone," is actually the anastrophe of the proper statement "This phone is my favorite thing", where "favorite thing" is a predicate.

Properties belong to a subject (ἐν ὑποκειμένῳ ἐστιν). Examples include colors, height, length, location, and so on: you will never encounter "blue" or "tall" on its own, but only as an attribute of a pre-existing thing.

Substance (ἡ οὐσία) opposes property. And what is that, substance? Indeed, the rest of this work -- and the overall movement of philosophy itself -- will radically address this question. But for the time being, you can think of substance as *individuality*: that by which you can single out something particular as being something particular.

But what about the subject? If predicates describe a subject, and properties belong in a subject, shouldn't the subject oppose them instead of particulars and substance?

Not exactly, because predicates and properties can themselves be subjects! For the human that this man is *is itself* an animal, and for this man who wears a jacket that is green, that green *is itself* a color. Then a subject can either be a particular thing, or predicates describing that thing, properties belonging in that thing, or predicates describing those properties.

Draw it out: according to what we have discussed so far, everything we say about anything, *speech itself*, appears to spiral out of what we call particulars, and particularly what we call substance.

The two conditions by which we can distinguish beings, as predicates or as properties, in turn produce a table with four categories:

|                                       | **Not a predicate**<br>**(Particular things)** | **Predicate** |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| **Not a property**<br>**(Substance)** | This man                                       | Man           |
| **Property**                          | This knowledge                                 | Knowledge     |

Here everything interlaces in a complex crossing:

-   **Property predicates** are generic descriptors of properties: knowledge, color, shape, and so on.
-   **Substantial predicates** are generic descriptors of particulars: human, horse, cars, and more general labels like animal, vehicle, and so on.
-   **Property particulars** are specific details about particular things: the flakiness of a pastry, the specific way someone walks, the sound your car makes when it turns on.
-   Then, finally, **substantial particulars**: the individual things -- that is, everything surrounding you at all times -- in the world that can be described with predicates and that possess properties (that in turn can also be described). But they never themselves describe or belong to anything else.

From this a certain *ordering* about the nature of the world has been implanted: there is a sense in which ideas, concepts, descriptions, generic terms, and possibly language itself *come second* to the particular things we encounter around us.

## Genera also describe things

In the language of Aristotle, predicates that describe actual things are "species." Predicates of these predicates are "genera."

Genera apply downward to the particulars. So if a man is a human, and humans are animals, then that man is also an animal.

Species of a genus are distinguished by "differentiae." Species of animal can be distinguished by being footed, winged, and so on.

Differentiae of one genus have no bearing toward an unrelated genus: knowledge, for instance, cannot be distinguished by footed, winged, and so on.

But differentiae of a genus can apply downward: the bird genus, underneath animal, itself contains species that may be distinguished as being footed (flightless), winged (flighted), and so on. This does not always hold (human is not distinguished by being footed or winged), but it is possible.

## The categories

Every word (uncombined utterance) ultimately refers to one of the following:

| English   | Greek   | Section        |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Substance | οὐσία   | @sec-substance |
| Quantity  | πόσος   | @sec-quantity  |
| Quality   | ποιός   | @sec-quality   |
| Relation  | πρός τι | @sec-relation  |
| Place     | ποῦ     | Not discussed  |
| Time      | ποτὲ    | Not discussed  |
| Posture   | κεῖσθαι | @sec-relation  |
| State     | ἔχειν   | Not discussed  |
| Action    | ποιεῖν  | Not discussed  |
| Affection | πάσχειν | @sec-quality   |

**Insofar as speech consists of words, these ten categories constitute the meaning of speech in general.**

**Insofar as speech refers to actual things, any being whatsoever must fall into one of these ten categories.**

Here also Aristotle notes here that only combined utterances, statements, strictly speaking, be true or false.

## Substance {#sec-substance}

There are two kinds of substance (ἡ οὐσία), first and second.

### First substance

First substance refers to *actual things*: these are the particulars we discussed above.

First substances is truly the *first word* in that it did not exist, there would be nothing else to talk about. The rest -- species, genera, differentiae, and properties -- would have no referent, and therefore could not be otherwise.

### Second substance

Secondary substances are the substantial predicates: species, genera, and differentiae that describe what actual things are.

Only second substance describes actual things synonymously. So if this man is a man, then the definition of man, animal, applies to him. On the other hand, properties of a man -- his skin tone -- do not proceed to define him as that genus -- a color. Therefore they are is homonymous.

Species is more substantial than genre:

* It is "nearer" to substance in that it is a more natural substitute: it is more sensible to refer to this man a man than it does to call him an animal.
* It also behaves more similarly in that it has less capacity for description than genre. (First substance, recall, cannot describe anything at all.)

Despite being predicates, second substances are still truly substances:

* They alone _define_ first substance. As noted above, you can measure whatever property you like about a man -- his height, his knowledge, age, posture, and so on -- but none of these will tell what what he actually is.
* They can be described just like first substance. So if this man walks on two legs and has knowledge, then man and animal can be described similarly. 
* Species and genre are never also properties belonging to a subject. Properties, as established above, name the subject homonymously, but secondary substances do so synonymously. For if this pen is a pen, that also makes it an artificial device.

### Defining substance

What is substance? Let us ask again.

#### First substance

We only seem, as we saw, to talk about substance, either by way of description or by property.

This is why defining substance by itself becomes tricky: without descriptions, we literally run out of words to describe it.

**All substance can possibly denote, then, is its _very ability to be pointed out_.**

This is what Aristotle means by his famous claim that substance appears to mark τόδε τι, "a this."

Here both words share equal weight:

* τόδε, "this," is a demonstrative: that which has been pointed out.
* τι, "a," is the indefinite pronoun: it conveys the generality of the definition.

When we strip particular things of their qualifiers, all they refer to in general is _their ability to be referred to_ as whatever they specifically are.

Substance, then, in an unusual turn of the word, is thoroughly _remarkable_: it is the very origin of every possible remark.

TODO: This also refers to the ACT of pointing substance out. Substance points to the _activity_ of pointing out.

old text:

This means any utterance, no matter how, what, where, or why it is said, must ultimately _refer to_ a primary substance.

This is exactly the definition Aristotle gives for primary substance: _something that has been pointed out_ (τόδε τι).

Substance never does any pointing: it never stands in for another entity. Instead substance is that which in every case is _pointed to_: clarified by predicates or described by properties. It is the seat of all possible signification.

For this reason substance itself cannot be defined as anything but the _mere act of pointing_

#### Second substance 

Accordingly, second substance is the defining remark: it distinguishes first substance by its *kind*. 

If first substance is remarkability, then second substance fills in this potential by telling us what it actually is.
