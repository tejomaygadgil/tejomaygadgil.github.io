## What is Neovim, and why?

Neovim is a terminal based text editor. It is a revamp of an older (but still very popular) editor called Vim.

Vim/Nvim are excellent tools but daunting to newcomers. That's I'm sharing what I've learned to help more people get into Nvim.

## Packages

For Data Science / programming / note-taking / publishing I recommend the [Quarto kickstarter](https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter). The shortcuts below are written with this configuration installed so YMMV.
