Welcome!

I'm Tejomay, a Data Scientist based in the SF Bay Area. 

I am passionate about engineering large-scale ML systems, particularly in NLP and Demand Forecasting.

I hold a Masters from NYU's Center for Data Science where I built models to combat misinformation at [CSMaP](https://csmapnyu.org/).

Previously I was a Public Policy researcher at [MDRC](https://www.mdrc.org/) and [University of Chicago](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment).
